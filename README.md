# PhotoBlog: A Practical Study of HTML and CSS

PhotoBlog is a project developed with the aim of exploring and demonstrating practical skills with HTML and CSS. Through this simple project, I seek a deeper understanding of how to structure web pages with HTML and how to style and animate elements using CSS. This fictitious blog serves as a platform to experiment and showcase various web design and animation techniques.

## Features

- **Clear HTML Structure:** The HTML code is organized in a clear and semantic manner, demonstrating a solid understanding of HTML tags and web page structuring.
- **Style and Decoration with CSS:** Utilization of CSS to style elements, create an attractive layout, and ensure a pleasant visual experience.
- **CSS Animations:** Exploration of different CSS animation techniques to create dynamic and engaging interactions on the blog.
- **Random Images:** The images displayed are generated randomly, serving as placeholders for visual content.
- **Decorative Buttons:** The buttons present are purely decorative, exemplifying the use of styles and CSS animations.

## Demonstration

This project serves as a visual and interactive record of my progress in learning HTML and CSS. Feel free to explore the code and animations presented on PhotoBlog.

### Note

This is a study project and does not have back-end functionalities. All content is static and interactions are limited to CSS animations.
